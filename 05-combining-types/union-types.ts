// * Union Types *
//
// TypeScript’s type system allows you to build new types out of existing ones using a large variety
// of operators. Now that we know how to write a few types, it’s time to start combining them in
// interesting ways.
//
// * Defining a Union Type *
//
// The first way to combine types you might see is a union type. A union type is a type formed from
// two or more other types, representing values that may be any one of those types. We refer to each
// of these types as the union’s members.
//
// Let’s write a function that can operate on strings or numbers:

function printId(id: number | string) {
  console.log("Your ID is: " + id);
}
// OK
printId(101);
// OK
printId("202");
// Error
// printId({ myID: 22342 });
// Argument of type '{ myID: number; }' is not assignable to parameter of type 'string | number'.

// * -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- *
// * Working with Union Types *
//
// It’s easy to provide a value matching a union type - simply provide a type matching any of the
// union’s members. If you have a value of a union type, how do you work with it?
//
// TypeScript will only allow an operation if it is valid for every member of the union. For example,
// if you have the union string | number, you can’t use methods that are only available on string:

function printId2(id: number | string) {
  //   console.log(id.toUpperCase());
  // Property 'toUpperCase' does not exist on type 'string | number'.
  //   Property 'toUpperCase' does not exist on type 'number'.
}

// The solution is to narrow the union with code, the same as you would in JavaScript without type
// annotations. Narrowing occurs when TypeScript can deduce a more specific type for a value based
// on the structure of the code.
//
// For example, TypeScript knows that only a string value will have a typeof value "string":

function printId3(id: number | string) {
  if (typeof id === "string") {
    // In this branch, id is of type 'string'
    console.log(id.toUpperCase());
  } else {
    // Here, id is of type 'number'
    console.log(id);
  }
}

// Another example is to use a function like Array.isArray:

function welcomePeople(x: string[] | string) {
  if (Array.isArray(x)) {
    // Here: 'x' is 'string[]'
    console.log("Hello, " + x.join(" and "));
  } else {
    // Here: 'x' is 'string'
    console.log("Welcome lone traveler " + x);
  }
}

// Notice that in the else branch, we don’t need to do anything special - if x wasn’t a string[],
// then it must have been a string.
//
// Sometimes you’ll have a union where all the members have something in common. For example, both
// arrays and strings have a slice method. If every member in a union has a property in common, you
// can use that property without narrowing:

// Return type is inferred as number[] | string
function getFirstThree(x: number[] | string) {
  return x.slice(0, 3);
}

// It might be confusing that a union of types appears to have the intersection of those types’
// properties. This is not an accident - the name union comes from type theory. The union
// number | string is composed by taking the union of the values from each type. Notice that
// given two sets with corresponding facts about each set, only the intersection of those facts
// applies to the union of the sets themselves. For example, if we had a room of tall people
// wearing hats, and another room of Spanish speakers wearing hats, after combining those rooms,
// the only thing we know about every person is that they must be wearing a hat.
